  # Hello everyone, welcome to Webbie-Trivia!!

  Webbie-Trivia is a Quiz game that see the players answering trivia questions while competing in the fictional game show Webbie!
Created specifically with multiplayer party gaming in mind.

  As with most TV Quizz shows, the winner of the game is the player with the most points. The show uses a multi-round format like most quizz games,
featuring ten individual rounds. Each round has a color, red for high, yellow for medium and white for low difficulty.

  Each round consists of a question where you have to be the fastest hitting the buzz (by typing anything and pressing Enter) so you can attempt
to give the correct answer and win full points... otherwise... the next player will attempt and win a percentage of those points... and remember,
if you fail you lose points.

  One of the core objectives of the game is to help in the learning proccess and ofcourse to HAVE FUN! 
  
  ### **Speaking of fun, hope you all have a blast with our game!**
